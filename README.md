# qbittorrent-theme

The original ayuDark theme from https://github.com/maboroshin/qBittorrentDarktheme has following bug:

You cannot see what is selected, and hover over an item does not highlight it. This has been fixed in ayuDark-fixed-seclected-items.qbtheme.

Additional change: The "black" is not actually #000000 and not #01060E, use ayuDark-fixed-seclected-items_2.qbtheme.
